        "\n",
        "So what is deep learning? **Deep learning** is an approach to machine learning characterized by deep stacks of computations. This depth of computation is what has enabled deep learning models to disentangle the kinds of complex and hierarchical patterns found in the most challenging real-world datasets.\n",
        "\n",
        "Through their power and scalability **neural networks** have become the defining model of deep learning.  Neural networks are composed of neurons, where each neuron individually performs only a simple computation. The power of a neural network comes instead from the complexity of the connections these neurons can form."

Each example in the training data consists of some features (the inputs) together with an expected target (the output). Training the network means adjusting its weights in such a way that it can transform the features into the target. In the *Big Mart Sales Prediction* dataset, for instance, we want a network that can take each product's `'Item_MRP'`, `'Item_Visibility'`, and `'Item_Weight'` value and produce a prediction for that product's `'Item_Outlet_Sales'` per store. If we can successfully train a network to do that, its weights must represent in some way the relationship between those features and that target as expressed in the training data.\n",

        "- A \"loss function\" that measures how good the network's predictions are.\n",
