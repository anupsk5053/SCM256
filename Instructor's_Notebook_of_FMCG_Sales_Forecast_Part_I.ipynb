        "# 1. Introduction\n",
        "We'll start with an overview of how machine learning models work and how they are used. This may feel basic if you've done statistical modeling or machine learning before. Don't worry, we will progress to building powerful models soon.\n",
        "\n",
        "This week will have you build models as you go through following scenario:\n",
        "\n",
        "As a graduate of the MIT SCM program you are hired by a large fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) company. They have put you in charge of creating a supply chain analytics department. The board wants to create this department as the company for decades relied on the intuition of the experienced staff. \n",
        "When talking with this staff you find out that they identified patterns in the revenues based on patterns such as holidays and sports events.\n",
        "\n",
        "Machine learning works the same way.  We'll start with a model called the Decision Tree. There are fancier models that give more accurate predictions. But decision trees are easy to understand, and they are the basic building block for some of the best models in data science.\n",
        "\n",
        "For simplicity, we'll start with the simplest possible decision tree. \n",
        "\n",

        "It divides the data into only two categories. The predicted price for any week is the historical average of weekly sales in the same category. \n",
        "\n",
        "We use data to decide how to break the sales data into two groups, and then again to determine the predicted revenue in each group. In this example we predict the sales of week with or without a holiday. This step of capturing patterns from data is called **fitting** or **training** the model. The data used to **fit** the model is called the **training data**.  \n",
        "\n",
        "The details of how the model is fit (e.g. how to split up the data) is complex enough that we will save it for later. After the model has been fit, you can apply it to new data to **predict** weekly sales in the future.\n",

        "\n",
        "The decision tree on the right (Decision Tree 2) probably makes more sense, because it captures the reality that in the week before a holiday revenue will be higher than usual. The biggest shortcoming of this model is that it doesn't capture other factors such as which month of the year it is. A FMCG store will probably have higher sales in the week before Christmas and Thanksgiving than in the week of Presidents day.\n",
        "\n",
        "You can capture more factors using a tree that has more \"splits.\" These are called \"deeper\" trees. A decision tree that also considers the month of the year might look like this:\n",

        "\n",
        "You predict the sales of any week by tracing through the decision tree, always picking the path corresponding to that characteristics of that week. The predicted price for that week is at the bottom of the tree.  The point at the bottom where we make a prediction is called a **leaf.**   \n",
        "\n",
        "The splits and values at the leaves will be determined by the data, so it's time for you to check out the data you will be working with."
